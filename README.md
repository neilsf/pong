# pong
My implementation of the legendary Pong game for C64

How to play
-----------
Open your C64 emulator and run the .prg file or use Vice's c1541 program to write it on a d64 image. More info about c1541: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_13.html

How to compile from source
--------------------------
The source code is in Turbo Macro Pro format, you'll need Tmpx to compile the source code. There is a shell script in the root of this repo to compile in one line. More info about tmpx: http://turbo.style64.org
