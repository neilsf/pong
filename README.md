# pong
My implementation of the legendary Pong game for the Commodore-64!

How to play
-----------
Open your C64 emulator and run the .prg file or use Vice's c1541 program to write it on a d64 image. More info about c1541: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_13.html

How to compile from source
--------------------------
The source code is in Turbo Macro Pro format, you'll need TMPx to compile the source code. There is a shell script in the root of this repo that you can use to quickly compile the program. More info about TMPx: http://turbo.style64.org

Found a bug?
------------
Fix it :-) or post an issue here on Github.
